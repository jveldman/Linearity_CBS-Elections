    "It won´t be long until the billboards will be constructed again, soon to be filled with the faces of local politicians: new elections are close. Wednesday the 16th of March, Dutch citizens will vote for the local municipality elections. Parties and statistical agencies try to predict the elections beforehand using a vast range of methods. Not only are polls and election predictions usefull for measuring the popularity of certain parties, it also helps strategic voters to optimize their votes. Next to that, political parties benefit significantly by knowing where their voters are located: Socialist, for example, will not convince many voters to vote for the Socialist Party when targeting the richest municipalities of the countries. This paper aims to find the relationship between the statisitics of municipalities and the amount of votes on the major Dutch political parties in a structured, automated way. This paper does not aim to suggest a different way of predicting elections as models to predict elections are developped to an extend that cannot be matched with a relatively simple python analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper will use the basic information from municipalities, obtained from the Dutch [Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=nl&_catalog=CBS&tableId=70072ned&_theme=233) using the CBS api [cbsodata](https://pypi.org/project/cbsodata/). The election data comes from the Dutch [Election Council (Kiesraad)](https://www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl/) and has been manually downloaded. I decided not to use [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) and [Beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to scrape the data from the website as that would complicate the replicability. The data is obtained per municipality. Although an analysis on the level of neighbourhoods would be more accurate considering it would make the differentiation between e.g. rich and poor, religious and atheistic areas possible, I chose not do this as the availablility of this data is not as good as on municipality level. Obtaining the election data per neighbourhood requires advanced knowledge of XML files and the key figures of the CBS  are either outdated or protected by a paywall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the large quantity of data used in this project, I chose to work with a database. The parent table will be a table that contains all the municipality codes that have ever existed in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2022. Such a table is necessary as there were many reclassifications of municipalities over the past twenty years. Considering I do not own a server, I decided to use the SQLite dialect for structuring my database. SQLite databases can be stored locally without the need to set up a server. Next to that, SQLite works very well with the pandas pachage, as the function pd.DataFrame.to_sql() and pd.read_sql() can easily interact with the database. \n",

    "## Parties\n",

    "Underneath, the parties incorporated in this research are displayed with their English translation and description. The description has been obtained from [parlement.com](https://www.parlement.com/id/vh8lnhrpfxut/partijen_in_tweede_en_eerste_kamer) and [nsd.no](https://o.nsd.no/european_election_database/country/netherlands/parties.html).  Since the most recent elections in 2021, splitt-offs have caused the number of parties to increase. However, as these parties have participated in clear minority of the elections between 2000 and 2022, they have not been added to this analysis. \n",

    "Using SQLite, it is not possible to set foreign keys after the table has been created in the database. Therefore, I need to set these keys manually in an SQLite script. Underneath the function that creates such a SQlite script based on several arguments. *table_name* requires the name you want to give the table in the database. *dataframe* is the table that has to be uploaded to the database. *primary_key* represents the column that should be set as primary, the input is a string. *foreign_key* represents the column that should be set as a foreign key. Note that the input of this parameter is a list, where the first item is the table, the second item the column it references to. *foreign_key* requires the names of the primary key and the foreign key to be the same. Both *primary_key* and *foreign_key* have the value 0 as standard. *Connection* represents the connection to the database, which is locally stored and therefore set to a folder."
